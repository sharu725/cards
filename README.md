# Installation: 
Fork the ``master`` branch and delete ``gh-pages`` branch in it. This is important because ``gh-pages`` branch is used here only to host the blog. You should be using the master branch as the source and create a fresh ``gh-pages`` branch.

Now, go to settings and check the **Github Pages** section. You should see a URL where the blog is hosted.

This process will host the theme as a **Project Page**. You can also download the files for local development. 

Default theme will look like this
